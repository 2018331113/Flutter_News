# flutter_news

A News application made by using REST API and Webview class.

## Description

This project is updated version of the following tutorial I've found in the Youtube.
[Build a Flutter News App with NewsApi Org | Flutter Tutorial For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaGcER1uUoE&t=4472s)

### Changes

- Created progress indicators while each and every page loads
- Made a method to check internet access so that the app can handle while you go offline 
    or other network issues.

Few dependencies that helped a quite well:

- [internet_connection_checker: For checking internet access ](https://pub.dev/packages/internet_connection_checker)
- [cached_network_image: For caching permanent data's from internet](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image)

If you find some way to upgrade it even more please do notify me.
